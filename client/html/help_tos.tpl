<p class='section' id='section-prohibited-content'><strong>Prohibited content</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Any content that is illegal or questionably legal in the great state of
    California. This will (obviously) result in an immediate ban and removal of
    your posts.</li>

    <li>Art that promotes harm and violence towards any ethnic, racial, cultural,
    sexual, or gender identity/group. Don't try to be sneaky and add little
    dogwhistles, I know them all and will notice, I assure you. This will also
    result in an immediate ban and removal of your posts.</li>

    <li>Photography of anything that is not your own work. This includes shots of
    nature, buildings, people, etc. This does NOT include photos of anything you
    created such as photos of costumes, clothing, paintings, structures you
    designed or worked on, shots from movies you worked on, sculptures, you get
    the idea. This is partly because photos of the city or whatever taken on
    expensive cameras are often large and this website has limited storage
    (that I pay for), and partly because I dont want the website filled with
    endless photos of random 'candid' shots or pics of roadkill or whatever.
    Posting such photography will simply result in the post being deleted(no ban),
    so if you are not sure if something you are uploading breaks this rule I
    encourage you to still post it. If I delete it I promise it is not personal
    or a statement about your photography being bad it just doesn't belong here.   </li>

    <li>Any content that includes identifiable information about ANYONE. This includes
    photos of people, or photos of people wearing something you made in which we can
    see their face.</li>

    <li>Art of a sexual nature is tenuously NOT prohibited if appropriately marked as unsafe,
    however there is a fine line between art that is sexual in nature and just straight up
    masturbation material. It is not prohibited in the spirit of not trying to limit others artistic expression,
    it isn't not prohibited in the spirit of having my website filled with drawings of ass, if
    that makes sense. This will be case by case and handled at my discretion, like the photography
    I encourage you to upload if you aren't sure whether your art crosses the line, and I will
    delete the post if it does. More than likely as long as ALL of your drawings aren't like this,
    the ones that are will stay up. Think of it as a matter of ratio of SFW to NSFW works, and trying
    to maintain a balance. </li>
